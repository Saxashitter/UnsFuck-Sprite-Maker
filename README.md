# UnsFuck Sprite Maker

This tool written in NodeJS is to make spritesers for the game UNSTOPPABLE FUCK. The game can be found [here](https://github.com/Saxashitter/UNSTOPPABLE-FUCK-Poyo-and-the-Refill-Mart)

# How to use

Make a ``sprites/`` folder in the same directory as the tool.
All sprites must be in .png for the packer to work, but you can modify the tool to make other formats work.

Open up your terminal, install the packages as so, and run the script.

It'll ask you ``Animation name:``. This is used for the name you'll have to index the sprite as in-game to change animations.

It'll also ask you ``FPS:``, then after that, the path to each sprite.

It finds files as ``sprites/${**InputtedName**}.png``. To find multiple sprites, separate them with ``;``

e.x. ``run1;run2;run3``.

Keep repeating until you get all the sprites. Have fun!
